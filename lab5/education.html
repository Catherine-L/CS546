                <h2>Middle School</h2>
                <p>The middle school I attended is named Lida Middle School in Suzhou. I was very bad at any classes required logical thinking, especially Maths.
                   I used to read a lot and favorite class was History. At this moment, there is not anything detailed I could remember about the life in middle school.</p>

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>I went to Soochow Academy at my hometown. My favorite class was Global History, and I still hated Maths the most just like the past.</p>
                <p>The school has some great international program, when I was a freshman, some exchange students from high school in United States arrived. It is probably my first time interact with foreigh students. </p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>I am current a Senior student at Stevens Institute of Technology to pursuit Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. </p>
                <p>It is difficult to pick a favorite academic class, so I will pick my favorite gym class instead. The most insteresting Gym I have taken is archery class, 
                    still remember there was one time I got the bull's-eye twice in one round but hit my elbow when the string of the bow bounced over. It was definitely memorable.</p>
