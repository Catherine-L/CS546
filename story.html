            <article>
                <p>I had a tarantula as pet when I was about 14. It was caught in the wild when we went hiking during a summer camp. When I found it, it was relatively small but fuzzy on its legs if look close enough.</p>
                <p>I kept it in a water bottle and brought it home. When my mom saw it, she wasn't realize what it actually is until seeing it moving, she screamed and was going to threw the bottle out of the window. </p>
                <p>After begging (and threatening cause I said I would do the same thing to her pet goldfish), I got to keep it but only in a closed container in my room. Since that day, my mom had never entered my room before the spider was gone. </p>
