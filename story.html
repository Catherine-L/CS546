In story.html, you will write a document telling a story that you'd like to share with the world.

Include a heading tag describing the page; for example, I would make mine say That Time I Overreacted and Bought a Macbook. You should also include a similar description in your titletag.
Create a main element with the necessary HTML content to tell your story.
